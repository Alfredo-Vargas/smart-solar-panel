# smart-solar-panel
MAIN PHYSICAL PRINCIPLE:
This project uses two LDRs to determine the lux at two borders of a solar panel. Then using a Servo motor we are able to change the orientation plane of a solar panel to maximize the lux incident on it. 

EXTRA FEATURES:
This project also includes a DHT11 sensor for humidity and temperature readings which together with the flux average readings are displayed on a LCD. Furthermore, an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) is also installed to active the LCD display only when a user comes into the vicinity of the ultrasonic sensor.
