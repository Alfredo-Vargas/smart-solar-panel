# smart-solar-panel
This smart solar panel besides the commonly used LDR's and servo motor, uses a temperature-humidity sensor and ultrasonic sensor for extra features.


This smart-solar-panel, is based on two LDR's readings which determine the orientation plane of the solar panel with more flux incidence. Furthermore, uses a servo motor to rotate the the solar panel to the desire position.

This whole device has a DHT11 sensor for humidity and temperature reading which together with the flux average readings are displayed on a LCD. An ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) is also included to display the temperature, humidity and average flux reading whenever a user comes into the vicinity of the whole device.
